# Hate Speech Detector
[Test it here]{https://hatespeechdetector.streamlit.app/}
## Overview
⋅⋅⋅This repository contains code and resources for building a hate speech detection system using machine learning techniques.

⋅⋅⋅Hate speech is a significant issue on social media platforms and online communities, and it is crucial to develop tools that can automatically detect and mitigate it. The goal of this project is to create a robust and accurate hate speech detection model that can be integrated into various applications and platforms to promote safer online environments.

## Introduction

⋅⋅⋅Hate speech detection is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying offensive, harmful, or discriminatory language targeted at individuals or groups based on attributes like race, religion, gender, ethnicity, etc. In this project, we aim to build a hate speech detection model using machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of text samples to learn patterns and identify hate speech in data.

## Dataset

⋅⋅⋅The dataset used for training and evaluating the hate speech detection model is included in this repository. It is downloaded from Kaggle, originally collected from Twitter and contains the following columns:

1. index
2. count
3. hate_speech
4. offensive_language
5. neither 
6. class
7. tweet
